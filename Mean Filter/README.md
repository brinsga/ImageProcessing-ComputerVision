# Mean Filters

Filters are used in image processing to denoise, smooth, detect edges, features etc. Image filtering techniques operate
on pixels and they vary the intensity of pixel values to obtain desired effect. 

Mean Filter is a image filtering technique where a kernel (a square matrix), usually a normalized box filter is slided across
the image. The intensity of a pixel is altered based on the values of the neighbouring pixel.

Mean Filters help with:
1. Denoising
2. Smoothing
